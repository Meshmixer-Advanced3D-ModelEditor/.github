## ❓ What is Meshmixer?

**Meshmixer** is a powerful and intuitive 3D mesh editing software developed by Autodesk. It is specifically designed to prepare and optimize 3D models before printing or slicing, offering an extensive set of tools for editing, analyzing, and refining STL/OBJ files.

Meshmixer is used worldwide by hobbyists, makers, engineers, and 3D artists to:

- Clean up messy scans and models  
- Combine and sculpt meshes  
- Hollow objects to reduce material  
- Create drain holes for resin printing  
- Automatically generate tree or lattice supports  
- Make boolean cuts and precise repairs  
- Inspect model integrity before export

With its **real-time feedback**, mesh analysis, and support for major 3D file formats, Meshmixer is ideal for workflows that require **pre-firmware preparation** before sending models to slicers or direct firmware tools.

Though Autodesk discontinued development, Meshmixer remains one of the most flexible mesh editing tools available — especially useful when preparing models for SLA, FDM, and resin-based printers.
